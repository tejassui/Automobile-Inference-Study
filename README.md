# Horsepower vs Number of Engines

There are many factors that determine the performance of a car. Previous research demonstrates that the engine efficiency is related to the volume and number of the cylinders (Emiroğlu et al., 2018). However, there are few and limited studies on the relationship between the number of cylinders and horsepower. In general, cars with different number of cylinders have different horsepower (Kellermayr et al., 2019). We are interested in the different effects on horsepower between the cars with 4- and 6-cylinder engines. Our question is: "Do cars with 6-cylinder engines on average have higher horsepowers than cars with 4-cylinder engines?" Since we are comparing the average horsepower we will use the sample mean (the location statistics), and the standard deviation (the scale statistics) of the horsepower to observe the spread in horsepower between the different samples.

Based on our question, our competing hypotheses are (where μ represents the average horsepower):

Null Hypothesis: There is no difference in horsepower between 4- and 6-cylinder engines in cars from 1970-1982 (μ6-cyl − μ4-cyl = 0)
Alternative Hypothesis: 6-cylinder engines have a greater horsepower than 4-cylinder engines in cars from 1970-1982 (μ6-cyl − μ4-cyl > 0)
